# Weather_dataset-python-project 
This project utilizes a weather dataset containing daily records of key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed, spanning several years. The goal is to uncover patterns, seasonal trends, and potential correlations between these variables, as well as to identify extreme weather events. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling, the project seeks to address questions about long-term climate trends, seasonal weather behavior, and predictive modeling for temperature. This analysis can support agricultural planning, climate research, and public awareness. Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

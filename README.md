# Weather_dataset-python-project 
This project utilizes a weather dataset containing daily records of key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed, spanning several years. The goal is to uncover patterns, seasonal trends, and potential correlations between these variables, as well as to identify extreme weather events. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling, the project seeks to address questions about long-term climate trends, seasonal weather behavior, and predictive modeling for temperature. This analysis can support agricultural planning, climate research, and public awareness. Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
What is the structure and content of the dataset?

Are there any missing values in the dataset?

What are the basic statistical summaries of the dataset?

How are temperature values distributed?

Is there a seasonal pattern in temperature, rainfall, or other variables?

What is the trend of maximum and minimum temperatures over time?

Is there a relationship between temperature and humidity?

Are there any extreme weather events, such as high temperatures or heavy rainfall days?

What is the average monthly rainfall?

Is there a long-term trend in rainfall?

What is the frequency and duration of rainy periods?

Are there any correlations among weather variables?

How does wind speed vary with different weather conditions?

Can we predict tomorrowâ€™s temperature using a simple linear model?

How can we visualize all the weather parameters over a given year?

These questions guide a comprehensive analysis of the weather dataset, aiming to reveal insights about patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
